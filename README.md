# CachexiaMuscleTimecourse

The Cachexia Muscle Timecourse (CMT) project aimed to assess cell type changes to the muscle microenvironment over the course of cancer cachexia. Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed on skeletal muscle from the hindlimbs of Sham and tumour-bearing mice (inoculated with subcutaneous Lewis-lung Carcinoma cells) at 2-weeks, 2.5-weeks, and 3.5-weeks post-inoculation. 

The manuscript that contains this data is currently under revision.
